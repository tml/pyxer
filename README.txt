PYXER
=====

Pyxer is a Python AJAX Server/ Framework similar to the
Jaxer project of Aptana. Instead of writing client side
code in Javascript you can  use Python. The Python code
will be translated to Javascript before send to the client.
You may also have server side code defined in the
HTML file that can asynchronously be called form the
client with seamless use of AJAX in the background.


INSTALL
=======

> python setup.py install


USAGE
=====

Start the demo server like this

> python pyxerdemo.py

Then open a browser an point it to

  http://localhost:8080
